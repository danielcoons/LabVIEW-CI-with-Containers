# Contributing to LabVIEW CI

This repository is the **tooling source**, not a client. Every repo listed on the
dashboard's Clients page installs from here, so a few things behave differently
than they would in a normal project.

## This repo is not a place to install the pipeline

The **LabVIEW CI configurator** (the "Integrate this CI pipeline" page) is a
*client installer*. It vendors a tooling payload pinned to a released version and
deletes files it does not recognise as current tooling.

This repository carries release machinery that no client has — `release.yml`,
`promote-release.py`, `discover-clients.yml`, the configurator pages themselves.
So running the configurator against this repo **or a fork of it** deletes that
machinery and overwrites `catalog.json` with an older version.

That is not hypothetical. On 2026-07-30 an install pinned at v4.11.10 landed on a
fork, downgraded the catalog from 4.12.4, removed 48 source-only files, and
stopped all client releases for two weeks.

The configurator now refuses this, and `catalog-source-sync` fails the PR if the
source-only files go missing. **To test the pipeline, install it into a separate
scratch repository.**

## Never edit `catalog.json`

`.github/labview-ci/catalog.json` → `version` is the version of record: the
release workflow reads it to cut the `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` tag and force-move
the `v<MAJOR>` alias every client pins to. It is release machinery, not a config
file, and **CI owns it**. You should never have it open.

Every merge to main is published automatically. CI derives the next version from
the highest published **tag** — never from the file — so a stale or conflicted
catalog cannot roll the version backwards. That's deliberate: on 2026-07-30 a
hand-edited copy took the version from 4.12.4 to 4.11.10 and stalled every client
release for two weeks.

What you supply instead, both optional:

**A release note.** Drop a `.md` file in `.github/labview-ci/notes/` describing
your change in prose, as a client would read it. One file per PR, so two PRs can
never conflict. CI folds pending fragments into the release and deletes them. See
[the notes README](labview-ci/notes/README.md). Forget one and the release still
happens, falling back to your PR title.

**A bump level.** Label the PR `release:minor` for a new capability or
`release:major` for a breaking change. No label means patch, which is right most
of the time. Major moves `@v<major>`, so it should be rare.

To land something without publishing, put `[skip release]` in the merge commit
message — but use it sparingly. Everything being published is what makes
retroactive promotion to beta and stable work.

## Channels, not version numbers, carry risk

Publishing is automatic and unconditional. Deciding a version is *good* is a
separate, manual, retroactive act: `promote-release.yml` moves the rolling
`stable` and `beta` tags to an already-published release. Nothing is rebuilt.

So don't agonise over a version number — it's a counter. The thing that decides
what a client actually receives is which release the channel points at.

## Reverts

If a PR is reverted, do **not** bring it back by merging main into your fork and
re-merging your branch — git treats the reverted commits as already merged, so
they silently return. Revert the revert (`git revert <revert-sha>`) on a fresh
branch, fix the actual problem, and open a new PR.

This is how the 2026-07-30 downgrade came back seven minutes after it was fixed.

## Repository settings this relies on

The guards are only as good as the branch rules that enforce them. On `main`,
under **Settings › Branches › Branch protection rules**:

- Require a pull request before merging
- Require review from Code Owners (activates `.github/CODEOWNERS`)
- Require status checks to pass → **`Catalog Source Sync`**

Without the required status check, `catalog-source-sync` reports a failure that
nothing acts on.
